## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

After a long time away from HTML and CSS, completing this challenge helped me remember how these work and how I can work with them. That is a simple task, I know, but completing it is an important step in my developer career.

### Continued development

I intend to continue increasing my knowledge in HTML and CSS, and add to this the knowledge about other important resources, like JS, PHP, and SQL.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me remember how and when to use certain tags in HTML and certain properties in CSS.
- [RBTech.Info](https://rbtech.info/cursos/) - This website with its courses helped me in different ways, like how to start with Git and GitHub.
